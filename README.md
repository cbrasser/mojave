This is a startpage concept built after the hacking minigame from the fallout game series.

Im not really using it as my startpage since i like having links available without solving a puzzle, usually.

After solving the puzzle you can interact with the page by typing into the prompt at the bottom:

- add: [url] [name] adds a link to the list
- rm: [name] removes a link
- setuser: [name] sets your name of choice as the user
